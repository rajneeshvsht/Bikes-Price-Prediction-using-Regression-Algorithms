# Bikes-Price-Prediction-using-Regression-Algorithms

Bike Price Prediction is a machine learning project that uses historical data to predict the price of a bike. This can be useful for bike sellers, who can use it to set a fair price for their bikes, and for bike buyers, who can use it to make sure they are not overpaying for a bike. The project will use a variety of machine learning algorithms, including __Linear Regression, Random Forest and XG Boost__ to predict the price of a bike. It will also use data visualization techniques to help understand the data and the results of the machine learning algorithms. 

# Steps Performed
1) __Data Preprocessing__ : Checked for outliers, incorrect values, missing values, duplicate, performed data type correction and string formatting.
2) __Exploratory Data Analysis__ : Performed Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis with various graphs and plots to better understand the distribution of features and their relationships.
3) __Feature Selection__: Used various feature selection techniques like Pearson Correlation Test, Exhaustive Feature selection to select the best features to build ML model.
4) __Model Building__: Implementation of various Regression Algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest and XG Boost to build a price predicting model.
      
# Tools and Technologies used
1) __Language__ : Python
2) __IDE__ : Jupyter Notebook
3) __Pandas__ : For loading the dataset and performing data wrangling
4) __Matplotlib__: For data visualization.
5) __Seaborn__: For data visualization.
5) __NumPy__: For some math operations in predictions.
6) __Sklearn__: For the purpose of analysis, prediction and evaluation

# Conclusion

Finally, the model is able to predict price of bike with an accuracy of __89%.__
