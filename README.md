# Bikes-Price-Prediction-using-Regression-Algorithms

This is a Machine Learning model designed to analyze various factors that contribute in deciding selling price of Bike. 

# Steps Performed
1) __Data Preprocessing__ : Checked for outliers, incorrect values, missing values, duplicate, performed data type correction and string formatting.
2) __Merging of datasets__ : In this project, recommender systems were built utilizing only explicit ratings. So finally,a new dataframe by merging the books dataset ,explicit ratings dataset and users dataset is prepared.
3) __Exploratory Data Analysis__ : Performed Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis with various graphs and plots to better understand the distribution of features and their relationships.
4) __Model Building__: Implementation of various Recommender System approaches like User Based Collaborative Filtering and Item based Collaborative Filtering.
      
# Tools and Technologies used
1) __Language__ : Python
2) __IDE__ : Jupyter Notebook
3) __Pandas__ : For loading the dataset and performing data wrangling
4) __Matplotlib__: For data visualization.
5) __Seaborn__: For data visualization.
5) __NumPy__: For some math operations in predictions.
6) __Sklearn__: For the purpose of analysis, prediction and evaluation

# Conclusion

Finally, the model is able to predict price of bike with an accuracy of __89%.__
